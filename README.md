Project 3: Spots
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.  

Spots uses CSS grids and flexbox for the main interface and adapative Web Design for the comfort of mobile users
